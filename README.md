# Wuhan Air Quality Analysis

## Annual AOD Variations 

### Data

MODIS (Terra and Aqua) AOD data from [Giovanni Platform][1], started from 2002 up to 2018-12-31.

### Results

![AOD Trend](img/MODIS_AOD_2002-2018(PS).png)

- Polluted period from 2002 to 2011 can be found with AOD of 0.88±0.05 at 550 nm
- Cleansing period from 2011 up till now with the slope of -0.06±0.01 per year can be found, because of the national-wide strict regulations and governmental control on the local emissions
- Yearly mean AOD of terra is larger than that of Aqua, which may be caused by the diurnal variations of aerosol at 11:00 (local time) for Terra and 13:00 (local time) for Aqua

## Ground-base Station Measurements

### Data

Data used in the analysis was measured by the national ground stations, which put into use since May 2014. The data was collected and released every week by Xiaolei Wang. All the data can be accessed with this [link][2].
The mean results from 9 stations were used to represent the air quality of Wuhan (34.53 N, 114.37 E). The locations of these stations can be found in the map below:

The data included 6 pollutants (listed below): 

- PM2.5
- PM10
- SO2
- NO2
- O3
- CO

and the air quality index ([AQI][3])
